# MVT Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is a simulation of the **Multiple Partitions - Variable Regions (MVT)** memory management technique used in operating systems. The simulation is implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **Java** and **JavaFX** for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Visualizes the allocation and deallocation of memory to processes.
- **Process Handling:** Allows loading of processes from a "ready" file and manages job execution dynamically.
- **Interactive GUI:** Provides an intuitive interface to monitor memory and process status in real-time.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8** or higher
- **JavaFX** (Included with JDK 11 or later, or can be downloaded separately for JDK 8)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Download ready.txt and job.txt
3. run the project and set files path
